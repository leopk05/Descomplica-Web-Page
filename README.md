# Nu Descomplica

This is my personal implementation for the challenge from a Brazilian course. I completed the entire project independently, without any code-along sessions, copying from others, or following tutorials. The challenge involved creating a shopping web page, and I decided to focus on the technology shopping niche, which turned out to be a great choice.

### What I learned

This project was a great learning experience for me as it challenged me to work with complex CSS selectors. Initially, I found myself struggling with selectors and feeling a bit lost. To overcome this, I decided to refactor my code and gain a better understanding of where things were located. To enhance my skills, I watched several videos on CSS best practices and applied them, along with some HTML techniques. This process greatly improved my proficiency in CSS and HTML.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to continue my journey in HTML and CSS development. There are a few specific areas I want to focus on:

- Grid Layout: I aim to enhance my understanding of CSS Grid and how to effectively utilize it to create more visually appealing and responsive layouts. Learning how to leverage grid systems will help me display content in a more efficient and organized manner.

- CSS Selectors: To avoid code repetition and improve code maintainability, I intend to deepen my knowledge of CSS selectors. By mastering advanced selector techniques, I can target specific elements more precisely and write cleaner, more concise code.

- Sass/SCSS: I am eager to explore modern CSS preprocessors like Sass/SCSS. These tools offer powerful features such as variables, mixins, and nesting, which can significantly streamline the CSS development process. By incorporating Sass/SCSS into my workflow, I can write more modular, reusable, and efficient stylesheets.

By focusing on these areas, I am confident that I will continue to enhance my HTML and CSS skills and stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends and best practices.
